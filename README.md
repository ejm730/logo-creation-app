## About

Logo Creator is a Node.js CLI application built to simplify the process of creating SVG logos. It allows users to specify shape, text, and colors, generating SVG files that can be used in web development, design, and other projects.

## Features

Interactive CLI:

The tool uses an interactive prompt to gather logo preferences.

Customizable:

Choose from a variety of shapes: circles, triangles, and squares.
Specify text (up to 3 characters) and its color.
Customize the color of your selected shape.
Save as SVG: The logos are saved in SVG format, ensuring scalability without losing quality.

Timestamped Filenames: Each generated SVG is saved with a unique timestamp, preventing overwrites and helping with version control.
